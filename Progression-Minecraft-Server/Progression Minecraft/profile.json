Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2024-02-28T19:40:53.632594Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":163700,"followers":83,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x","Xdw9cSFG","rmDI9Owy","H2MVcwUf","3OJWvUG9","ssXkoBKk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"3OJWvUG9","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 2.5.3","version_number":"2.5.3","changelog":"-Fix bounds crash with ModelBox randomCube method","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-02T02:22:36.783763Z","downloads":31580,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0c3174a02624af3044ae36e3a1b5e11314605e72fd3271ba3a03c548cfd04fbd3d2aa4e6d5c194e30b1febc94084b647251bee419e009bcf83aba26ddb156006","sha1":"b145c7849b7695c0d6d14bd7245eaaab8a27a38e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/3OJWvUG9/citadel-2.5.3-1.20.1.jar","filename":"citadel-2.5.3-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3175394,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"ssXkoBKk","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 2.5.4","version_number":"2.5.4","changelog":"-Fixed slow chunk load times caused by SurfaceRules\n\n-Added example rainbow shader","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-28T19:40:54.447673Z","downloads":7605,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e7f209ae09cf818ecf98698482b82a1cbe0fe058","sha512":"98f3610b2ee6782211369b7beedb57392d41db3bf0f0ce143fe349ab783766429bb3049f0dbe5ee7998430f19d53e674348caf0cafd6c84a7d379ec6cea17ad4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/ssXkoBKk/citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar","filename":"citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3181461,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-2.5.3-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\gravestone-forge-1.20.1-1.0.14.jar":{"sha512":"58faa35019778ff9162ecbaa5362895b2d25a132c2e86acaa47ead7400f741737e7ac662e14642ffc5adbba4f6afa81419aa534385406da913524a47296e4f4a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Gravestone Mod","description":"Places a gravestone with your inventory items inside when you die","authors":["Max Henkel"],"version":"1.20.1-1.0.14","icon":"C:\\Users\\tvpat\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\68f2878a83cf8e7061fb35426e45c6b792470526.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"gravestone-forge-1.20.1-1.0.14.jar"},"mods\\carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar":{"sha512":"4f75afb703dd71c322d4e2e27d28d7ab4afeb0c242bcee6d1eb5fef59ee4347352f1ca55f1826743957d2e95a951ed13884356485b0a979b14010915079e2c29","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"joEfVgkn","slug":"carry-on","project_type":"mod","team":"4y59IILI","title":"Carry On","description":"Carry On allows you to pick up Tile Entities and Mobs and carry them around!","body":"Ever wonder why you can carry a stack of 64 empty chests in your pocket, but you can’t move a filled one with your bare hands? Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":350275,"followers":618,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"edGQD16r","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-03-02T19:41:37.740347Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":679231,"followers":405,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB","7r8TleZN","GaHAWKFN","aoXpagIV","5Ic61SOJ","Y2coeQBy","wldQnfTY","WRTGYYwK","rL76IQAG","kWp5Y5C9","FSr3bS7l","g1NYtQkD","sBdauEYc","jwHI7W1V","Hrg4AXGA","cP4hkgv1","CUoXbepB","zRXo9SbS","zYK4kSID","7X9Ap8XG","OS1Spie4","nOP9IgtT","qZEcqr3j","H78hNSMP","u5W05Nll","uKalHaQF","DCYqLiyn","yui9wjUi","vivHKObd","2RDhJhN7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/twkfQtEc/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"rL76IQAG","project_id":"twkfQtEc","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"forge_1.20-2.9.17","version_number":"forge_1.20-2.9.17","changelog":"added

Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":274247,"followers":565,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"AxgOboGq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen.

As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **60 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 6 buckets of fluid or even 24 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, higher tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset upgrades, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nYou are able to use crafting inside the backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cRRnmSb.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XBB0wlj.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ufbnlYZ.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

It aims to add lots of new features to give players a chance to venture deeper into the Aether dimension, while also maintaining its original style.","body":"\n![Deep Aether Title Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045643746089373747/1104824924520063126/image.png)\n\n## What is this about?\n\n \n\nThe Deep Aether is an addon for the Aether Mod for Minecraft for 1.19.2 and beyond.\nIt aims to add lots of new features to give players a chance to venture deeper into the Aether dimension, while also maintaining its original style. Basically, we aim to give the Aether the \"1.16 Nether Expansion Update\" treatment.\n\n## What's new?\n\nNew Biomes:\n - Aerglow Forest\n - Blue Aerglow Forest\n - Aerlavender Fields\n - Yagroot Swamp\n - Golden Heights\n \nNew Ores, Tools, and Armor:\n - Skyjade (found in Holystone; has blocks, armor, tools, and weapons)\n     - Skyjade's ability is powerful upon first use, but gets weaker the more durability is lost; basically the opposite of Zanite's ability.\n - Stratus (found in Sterling Aerclouds, which can be enchanted to Chromatic Aerclouds, and Stratus Ingots can be crafted from them; has blocks, armor, tools, and weapons)\n     - Stratus's ability is slow falling, an upgrade of Gravitite's ability (high jump), and a dash ability: press R with a full set (including the gloves).\n  \nNew Trees and Wood Sets:\n - Roseroot and Blue Roseroot (Aerglow and Blue Aerglow Forests)\n - Yagroot (Yagroot Swamp)\n - Cruderoot (Yagroot Swamp)\n - Conberry (Golden Heights)\n - Sunroot (Golden Heights)\n \nNew Mobs:\n - Aerglow Fish\n - Aether Quail\n     - Has multiple color variants\n \nNew Stone Types:\n - Clorite\n - Aseterite\n \nNew Blocks:\n - Aether Mud and Aether Mud Bricks\n - Unique grass and path blocks for the Golden Heights biome, as well as the Aether Moss Block for the Yagroot Swamp\n - Normal decorative variants for new wood, stone, and ores\n - Unique flora for all added biomes, and the Golden Vine Fruit for the Golden Heights biome\n - Aerglow Block (crafted from Aerglow Petals, which come from Radiant Orchids and Flowering Roseroot Leaves)\n - Virulent Quicksand (functions like how quicksand does in real life, as well as Powdered Snow; immediate suffocation when fallen through)\n - Aersmog: A type of Aercloud that is created from the mixture of Water and Poison. Inflicts the Inebration effect when stepped on.\n - Sterling and Chromatic Aerclouds\n - New variants of Holystone and Mossy Holystone\n \nNew Items:\n - Golden Grass Seeds (drops from Golden Grass (not the block version); can be crafted with swet balls into a new swet ball type, which can turn Aether Dirt into Golden Grass)\n - Music Disks: \"Nabooru\" and \"A Morning Wish\" by Emile van Krieken (these tracks were originally meant for the Aether I mod a long time ago, but were never implemented)\n \nNew Dungeon Loot:\n - Spooky Ring: Increases damage dealt during the nighttime.\n\nNew Liquid:\n - Poison: It's the normal poison bucket from the Aether I mod, but now you can place it as a liquid (like water), and it naturally spawns in the Yagroot Swamp biome\n\nMod Cross Compat:\n - Aether Lost Content\n     - Skyjade and Cloudium Shields\n - Aether Redux\n     - Brick and Tile variants for Gilded, Frosted, and Blightmoss Holystone\n \n## Requirements\n\nYou'll need of course:\n\n   - Forge\n   - Aeroblender - This mod is **REQUIRED** for the biomes to work!!\n   - The Aether Mod (The 1.19.4 version)\n\nYou will also need:\n\n   - GeckoLib\n \n## FAQ\n\n__Q: Do you plan on backporting to earlier versions?__\n\n   - A: No we don't. The Aether I Mod only plans releases from 1.19.2 and onwards, meaning this addon cannot reach versions that are prior to that.\n   - This also includes future unofficial backports and all the legacy versions: our team only disposes of 2 coders that work on Deep Aether as a hobby, and maintaining older versions with a completely different codebase, while also fixing and updating the newer ones in acceptable timescales would be impossible.\n   - We have no issues with people that want to backport Deep Aether by themselves, letting us know first, and reminding that the backport is not official nor maintained by us.\n\n__Q: Where can I get Sterling Aerclouds?

It'll wiggle funny if you hit it, screaming large numbers of damage at you. It can be dressed up to look even more awesome. This will please the dummy, making the numbers smaller.\n\nTL;DR: target dummies show damage dealt to them and can be equipped with armor\n\n \n\nUsage:\nRight click on a block with a target dummy to place it. He can be rotated 16 different directions depending on the way you face when you place it, similar to an armor stand.\n\nYou can start dressing the little dude with all kind of armors and equipment. Just right click him with the desired item. To unequip a certain armor piece just click on his corresponding body part.\n\nGot tired of testing your dps? You can remove the dummy just by shift left clicking him with an empty hand!\n\n \n\nAdditional features:\nHave you ever wanted to test your new smite sword but couldn't because there are no skellies around? Well fear no more, you can now equip the dummy with and undead mob head and it will change its type accordingly!\nSimilarly you can equip him with a turtle helmet to make it a water mob or with a pillager banner to turn it into a pillager mob. Note that he still won't be attacked by other mobs (maybe it a future update), he'll just take more damage from appropriate enchantment and so on.\n\n \n\n Need automating? You can dispense the dummy using a dispenser and you can break him by removing the block under his feet.\n \n\n Don't like how much he swings or the new skin? Well you can easily change that by using the mod config file. You can additionally choose between static and dynamic dps messages and you can make the numbers show hearths instead of damage.\nTry shearing the dummies to get a different skin!\n\n \n\nYou can also equip them with a pumpkin or jack o lantern and they'll act as scarecrows, scaring nearby animals\n \n\n \n\nFull list of changes from original 1.12 bonusboni's mod:\n \n\nLots of stuff here, more than half of the mod was re written.\n\nNew skin!\nAdded support for more than one damage number. They now have a fading animation to clarify which is the newest.\nNumbers change their colors depending on the type of damage dealt. For example critical hits are red and lightning damage is yellow. Try it out!\nAdded dispenser support\nCan mimic mob types by equipping different items.\nUpdated the model and animation so that the head stays attached to the body\nThe dummy now reacts to all damage types\nCan be killed with /kill command, by withers and by void damage.\nDps number now appears on the status bar. You can choose between static and dynamic dps in the config.\nAdded configs to change a few aesthetic things\nEquipping and unequipping functions alot more like an armor stand\nBase is a bit smaller and centered on the block grid\nCustom armor models from other mods render properly (only 1.16 for now)\nSwinging animation is not much smoother\nAct as scarecrows when equipped with a pumpkin\nFixed some bugs\n","published":"2022-11-13T02:03:58.377412Z","updated":"2024-01-22T03:09:49.161482Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":132592,"followers":190,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qo2XMMhP","XYByr7D5","La9N7Ttu","zCPdDOOP","gEbry6GM","lTTirNtq","NKpNuhkD","zFPaMFa0","yMmYJ5I3","HPj6DZ24","S6QNPOFv","2ykUPWwJ","PcKbqBY4","Jt0fxF3M","ZganhQm7","hGI5KQLh","mQfY3H0A","rY6H6hgv","UvxYYzDm","EI0ydz1r","9nNuKVUq","ydAkQ5P1","TFlgTQCK","owOKOJTn","AAiySuI2","UxWhycwZ","OktgetPL","4IxqrWac","aD0lXWYG","Wsi8MeIx","evFX9Ei5","WovXXEkH","VEQbqZhv","EwVfOzqs","xzyrFq6U","oejSEBjB","7MCqqDqj","8gDpcYEM","GClsjyQs","zQNItGls","fkn90qf0","G6J2yYte","sQU1xRdi","qhumF2VU","QOOGkq3O"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Adega8YN/f5e7ffbd18426c584bd43b59770fb2965d420c9f.png"},"version":{"id":"qhumF2VU","project_id":"Adega8YN","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.20-1.8.14","version_number":"1.20-1.8.14","changelog":"fixed some damange number colors not working","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-22T03:09:44.546882Z","downloads":5092,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d360667bf7fdc45659f585710955ef6e0af5bc76","sha512":"7878968039df5a5f8ed3f410681f7196f51475553d28f92f7f740e893820f3f356902ade3bac0c9d2eea1ceea89a97de7ec5f894f6ccf631a9a315b6420d4f21"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Adega8YN/versions/qhumF2VU/dummmmmmy-1.20-1.8.14.jar","filename":"dummmmmmy-1.20-1.8.14.jar","primary":true,"size":343319,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"twkfQtEc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"BuHgkJRZ","user":{"id":"VEySDMZq","username":"Plantkillable","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68317386?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-15T03:56:18.312909Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist 2","ordering":0},{"team_id":"BuHgkJRZ","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dummmmmmy-1.20-1.8.14.jar"},"mods\\okzoomer-forge-1.20-3.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"0d66d6ba98ae9e00e8378dfee5c16d0e9885a568061b93852679de8fe17aa6bbfae0dcb07ee19bf241d7b4a3b6062cac560b18741603a383407cc1c0ab010ac5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"OkZoomer","description":"Adds a highly-configurable zoom key for Forge.

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-02-12T22:46:13.376542Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1755918,"followers":2045,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"WdbHS4uT","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.2+1.20 (Forge)","version_number":"3.2.2+1.20-forge","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Backport a very important Forge fix to 1.20.1 ([#143](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/143)) *Enjarai*\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-12T22:46:14.453888Z","downloads":5707,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c86b4f39e5388ab31f8e627b477cd59063b539101970acc6accfbbd1a7f81d45b2420f8b2df2c6c10fc3594a8915473bd0e0d5a0a979c90fad21e4d02444a5a6","sha1":"12335cc91e372b646e607daa24e1a4f5f524bef3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/versions/WdbHS4uT/yet-another-config-lib-forge-3.2.2%2B1.20.jar","filename":"yet-another-config-lib-forge-3.2.2+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":984522,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nwpe87D0","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"yet-another-config-lib-forge-3.2.2+1.20.jar"},"mods\\Pehkui-3.7.12+1.20.1-forge.jar":{"sha512":"290a4a6b57913076907111aa294ed7e8b1e7e79b04c4cbaf6eee3778304403fb3f4fe8570b3542e4d24965aecad4a2bb9bf216f9be179dd4f9af0cc2f5ef8afc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"t5W7Jfwy","slug":"pehkui","project_type":"mod","team":"qgpXhvkY","title":"Pehkui","description":"Lets you change the size of most entities, shrinking them smaller or growing them larger","body":"&nbsp;  \nThis mod allows for most entities to have their size changed, either enlarging or shrinking them.  \n&nbsp;  \nIt also provides an API that other mods can make use of to manipulate the size of entities and the time it takes for their size to change.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nThe Quilt/Fabric version is the actively supported version and will receive features, updates, and fixes first.

All code is open source and documented. **Only the 1.19.4+ versions required this. The old 1.12.2 builds do not.**\n\n🧪 Latest Updates\n-----------------\n\nDec 4, 2023 - Lost Content has been updated to 1.20.1. Works with Aether 1.20.1-v1.0.0.\n\n📚 Summary\n----------\n\nThis mod aims to bring back, and give life to a lot of scrapped, unused, and even concepted content and features from The Aether’s past. This gives even things that never made it out of the idea stage a chance. This includes content from Aether I, and even Aether Legacy itself. Any content that did not have any special ability or purpose will be given one, example being the Aerwhale King, which only existed as a name.\n\nWhile the mod does not aim to implement much Aether II Genesis/Mutation era content, there are exceptions. Features currently included from that era are purely visual, and were able to be slotted in as-is.\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer\n-------------\n\nThis mod may be missing some lost content, as either we had no idea on what it could’ve been, or we didn’t get to it. Some content included may be unfinished, or may even be changed. Some included content may not fully/accurately represent what it may have been. However we have done our best to make the content as fleshed out as possible.\n\n❓ What does everything do exactly?\n----------------------------------\n\nIf you need to figure out what something does, the Book of Lore will give you any details you need! If it says it doesn’t do anything special yet, then it will have it’s ability added in the future.\n\n![Aerwhale](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/735923610967053025-04-25-2023-1682477384.png)\n\nNew Dungeon: Platinum Dungeon\n-----------------------------\n\nThe platinum dungeon was concepted to be the fourth dungeon to finalize the mod! We took that idea and design the dungeon and boss fight as the Aerwhale King!\n\nOther Additions\n---------------\n\n![](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/951470492423634468-04-25-2023-1682477255.png)\n\n**Gale Stone** A cool, blue stone that makes up most of the Platinum Dungeon’s structure. It cannot be destroyed until the Aerwhale King is defeated.\n\n**Light Gale Stone** The glowing version of Gale Stone. It can be found in the Platinum Dungeon along with Gale Stone. Likewise, it cannot be collected until the boss is defeated.\n\n**Songstone** The sound this legendary stone makes can only be heard fully by the Aerwhale King. The sound keeps his mind in a tranquil state. If activated, he will prepare for battle.\n\n**Power Gloves** These gloves increase force behind the wearers punches. When using them to punch, they knock enemies much farther back than usual.\n\n**Platinum Key** A super shiny key awarded by the Aerwhale King after being defeated. You can use it to claim the treasure on the second floor of the dungeon!\n\n**Invisibility Gem** A stone that has a chance to allow the wearer dodge a blow, concealing them, possibly helping them to escape a rough situation.\n\n**Phoenix Pickaxe** The metal of this pickaxe is molten hot, it melts through stone, allowing the smelting of ores instantly.\n\n**Phoenix Sword** A heavy, molten sword which burns its foes to a crisp. It almost hurts to touch! Using this on animals can make them drop cooked meat!\n\n**Phoenix Shovel** The head of this shovel is molten hot, it smelts sand, and similar blocks when touched.\n\n**Phoenix Axe** The head of this axe is molten hot, it melts through wood, it chars wood on contact.\n\n**Phoenix Cape** A warm cloak. It has the power to give the wearer a second chance at life, should they get close to falling into the void.\n\n**Shield of Emile** A shield that’s said to have been used along with the Hammer of Kingbdogz. It has some scratches on it. It reflects blocked projectiles as if they were yours!\n\n**Gravitite Shield** A shield made completely of Gravitite. It can be used to block attacks. It causes much more knockback when something attacks it.\n\n**Zanite Shield** A shield made completely of Zanite used to block attacks. It doesn’t seem to have any special quirks. Regardless of that, it is more durable than the typical wooden shield.\n\n**Sentry Shield** This shield seems to be ancient sentry technology. It grants the wearer immunity to explosions. It also has a chance to detonate when attacked. Both of these things damage the shield.\n\n**Agility Boots** A rare pair of boots found in the Platinum Dungeon. They’re very light and aerodynamic, allowing for faster movement.\n\n**Swetty Mask** What looks to be the body of a Swet. Other than its aesthetic appearance, it can be used to negate crash damage while using an Elytra.\n\n**Crystal Sapling** These blue saplings will grow into Crystal Fruit Trees. They can be grown faster with Bone Meal.\n\n**Brown Moa Egg** A mysterious brown egg of a Moa not found in the wild. If a Blue and Orange Moa are near each-other, they can be observed laying these eggs. Hatching this provides a Brown Moa with decent speed, and 3 mid-air jumps, of which are stronger than usual. These Moas are also immune to the effects of inebreation. Once grown, Brown Moas can lay these eggs as expected.\n\n**Orange Moa Egg** An egg laid by an Orange Moa. The egg is surprisingly light. When incubated produces an Orange Moa with 2 mid-air jumps. This Moa has a special ability that allows it to speed up gradually when moving in a single direction. Strafing does not seem to harm its speed directly, but does make it speed up slower. Turning decreases its speed. When grounded, it gains speed much slower than it would otherwise in the air.\n\n**Legacy Disc** A baby blue colored record disc. When inserted into a jukebox, it plays Legacy by Lachney.\n\n---\n\n🌐 Translate Aether: Lost Content - help break the language barrier!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll translators are credited here that have translated the mod to their native languages.

Some of its features include:\n\n### 📚 Read the Structure Gel API Documentation Here\n\nFor an open source working example of this api, check out [Dungeons Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeons-plus)\n\nYou can find detailed information on how to develop and use this API by Minecraft version.\n\n**Latest Documentation**\n- [1.16+](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.16)\n\n**Older Documentation**\n- [1.15.2](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.15)\n- [1.14.4](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.14)\n\n## 🧪 Latest Features\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWO5BqSd29E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## 🛠️ Building Tools\n\n**The Building Tool is a new creative mode only item used to perform various large scale block alterations.**\n\n- It can be found in the Structure Items creative mode tab.\n- Right click the Building Tool in the air to open the GUI. Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## 🍡 Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## 🍮 Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build. If this structure were loaded into the game, the gel inside would be replaced with air, while the air outside would not be placed.\n\n![house_example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/d825a427e103a45857cc527bd3027f3736bc2eb1.gif)<br>\n\nThe code for this block is designed in a way such that you can easily extend it and hook into its behavior with methods in blocks.IStructureGel, should you need behavior not already implemented.\n\nThis is a core mod that modifies a few internal classes. If you get a crash with this mod that only occurs when mixed with another mod, this may be the cause. Please test before reporting.\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2023-05-21T23:11:08.916649Z","updated":"2024-02-04T18:56:20.054195Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":118651,"followers":31,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rrIuQG5f","YtlOh5ib","n7xrHFAI","hoSPdpVk","sC5VyD3U","Yj94wn7H","bsBVjIWk","bgOjiT8y","pCNl93Ka","DjvKx9sL","p2hBgWM7","Wcqj3c1P","czn0eUba","CrRybArg","WdmDpRR4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/80dbc0d2d3acadcfcfc1bfa79488f0d353bac1ea.png"},"version":{"id":"Wcqj3c1P","project_id":"T8TGycIQ","author_id":"QlRPeSYG","featured":false,"name":"Structure Gel API v2.16.0","version_number":"2.16.0","changelog":"# 1.20.1-v2.16.0\n\n## LoadStructureTemplateEvent\n- New event that fires after a `StructureTemplate` loads.\n- Contains methods to modify the blocks and entities within the template.\n\n## Gel Blocks\n- Now automatically perform their function without needing to implement the structure processor or use a specific StructurePiece type. \n\t- If the processor is already present, it will still use that.\n\t- This will not be done when loading a template through Structure Blocks or the `place template` command.\n\n## IModifyState\n- Any `TemplateStructurePiece` that extends `IModifyState` will now work with it as long as the `postProcess` method isn't overwritten.\n\n## Data Handler\n- All handlers can now mark blocks for post processing in the Properties menu. \n\t- Useful for making sure water flows after being placed, or updating fence connections for neighboring structures.\n\t- The position marked for post processing will be the position of the data handler itself, with the applied offset.\n- Added `structure_gel:empty` as an empty data handler.\n\t- Its primary function is to set an offset and mark a position for post processing.\n\t- This is not used by default if the data handler can't be loaded from nbt.\n- Fixed the `structure_gel:block_state` using `structure_gel:chest` for its data parser.\n\n## Building Tool\n- The Shape tool now has Hollow Cube, Cube Frame, Pyramid, and Cone.\n\t- Changing the shape now uses a selection panel instead of clicking to cycle to the next value.\n- The Fill tool now supports all the shapes from the Shape tool for fine control over shapes (replaces the old Mode property).\n- The Clone tool now temporarily saves its selected region into a clipboard.\n\t- This allows for cloning to an area far away, regardless of the source being loaded.\n\t- The region is not actually saved to the item itself, but rather to an external file in the dimension's `data` folder..\n\t- This results in drastic client performance improvements, especially for large selections.\n- The Replace tool now has a \"Fuzzy\" property that allows only replacing directly attached neighbors or diagonal neighbors.\n- Fixed a number of vertex sorting issues with the Clone tool.\n- Translatable text values in the GUI's now scroll like vanilla options buttons.\n- Action history is no longer stored in a level capability. It has been moved to `SavedData` files to allow for more dynamic loading.\n\n## Block Entities\n- Added `IRotatable` interface.\n\t- Allows a block entity to be rotated and mirroed when placed in a structure.\n\t- Contains `void mirror(Mirror)` and `void rotate(Rotate)`.\n\t- Supported by vanilla's `StructureTemplate` (mixin), `GelTemplate`, relavent data handlers, and relavent Building Tool modes.\n\n## Misc\n- Added an abstract item interface: `StructureFinderItem`\n\t- Contains basic methods to get/set located structure info within itself.\n- Improved performance with data handler processing.\n- Some registry events have been deprecated. They will become NeoForge registries in 1.20.4.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-22T08:10:47.454204Z","downloads":17132,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d5d3ada50c8e0f05065e7d5e51619d6c6e71d16cb70a571350172c5ef1a577c52ceb0b9e54b9fcf16fb15d7354db3629dabcb7016ed8cf45665bcb15f2d75891","sha1":"cf2225192e43316ab2ce99368eb7c59b4b08ac58"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/versions/Wcqj3c1P/structure_gel-1.20.1-2.16.0.jar","filename":"structure_gel-1.20.1-2.16.0.jar","primary":true,"size":961824,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"JuGQbIAJ","user":{"id":"QlRPeSYG","username":"SilverDavidMC","name":"Silver_David","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15661705?v=4","bio":"Programmer and artist for Modding Legacy.

library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI/discussions).\n\n## About\n\nThe Forgified Fabric API (FFAPI) is a direct port of [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) to Minecraft Forge, regularly kept up to date with the upstream repository. It is designed to make cross platform mod development easier by allowing developers to use Fabric API as a common library to interact with the game's code on both platforms. However, it is not an abstraction layer, and loader-specific code still needs to be handled separately for each platform.\n\n## Using Forgified Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have installed MinecraftForge first. More information about installing Forge can be found [here](https://github.com/minecraftforge/minecraftforge/#installing-forge).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.","published":"2023-06-16T16:03:25.810147Z","updated":"2024-02-22T18:27:51.914308Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":125592,"followers":284,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["Jj3KPVgK","sbT4Fjkz","XHvh7FnM","sGly1Rdo","PGFCRmyV","Ri84g8eX","QqpyiDh3","qv3A2YpL","S13JUxqv","6SG9khep","VcKidDJZ","YlahjL85","A8PNwlLL","YCdTpXDB","3TtugPt5","ckWkgWum","LhzI37DT","EWT0sz4G","VikUQCse","GXsbrT9S","p4QdTfJp","MjFgJuFO","4gsjvgjb","hza2Pxkz","8Ul21COc","UKf9cRzu","LLJcUxlF","XBKbNMW0","ATHkZpTi","vaAgRqsU","gRhlWhje","FEqdSJI1","9GRsNyR6","1JL8ugtS","bEVmNAGL","SkCa3i3J","Sc7HevsV","OiT1op2U","qhiUNT1A","vPLJkp8k","bcoTpHHY","MThJZev4","oQftcYQR","VQqVZLxu","TO2BhEmw","KTZtMyO5","Uuh9LOe5","mA9zMqdH","9QsnWfRl","lQX6g7sR","VwsM2bqh","uOV85sJq","XuoLHncM","oZi6BlS7","S34llcH8","rdpIJ7r3","BO4fgdx5","9euYpXCc","kioCTZ1N","q5kbwIvk","1SWYhNrt","Qg5o7JEY","pWa2YXuc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Aqlf1Shp/4f07a8f75b254b7a879d64a2bbeb10cfa583db4a.png"},"version":{"id":"pWa2YXuc","project_id":"Aqlf1Shp","author_id":"5qUpS9rY","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1] Forgified Fabric API 0.92.0+1.11.3+1.20.1","version_number":"0.92.0+1.11.3+1.20.1","changelog":"- Add internal FabricItemGroup class (Su5eD)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-22T18:27:52.839449Z","downloads":9033,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1042031096f1b0f2238ec3b56b8a55435fcc73feca68596a5787d69db46cd86b92cf2800b62f7ba4f27abbede8455256f5c51117261eeedc15a95e355f1d602e","sha1":"06d86409adeb6d8f677e862e6704df625ecd9ce6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Aqlf1Shp/versions/pWa2YXuc/fabric-api-0.92.0%2B1.11.3%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"fabric-api-0.92.0+1.11.3+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3036869,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-api-0.92.0+1.11.3+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\cosmeticarmorreworked-1.20.1-v1a.jar":{"sha512":"85bd5946cbbed8fa4cf2d98b3001ea578a2c312a5844553b01c78365de50f31961cb1f21be187fccec36bdb4947cea3b0b131836df0ee0cbdb0a5ac30d4155f6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"CosmeticArmorReworked","description":"This mod allows you to wear two sets of armor, one for display, one for function.

So all client will download the picture themselves.\n\nTo add your own pictures, i recommend to use imgur or similar websites.\n\nRequires <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/creativecore\">CreativeCore</a> and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/watermedia\">WaterMedia</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fot6dz175cgr1s5lrf1j0/Creative_Frame_Recipe.zip?rlkey=l16931scgitvxypnvrvt0s3oi&dl=1\">Crafting recipe for creative frame Datapack</a>\n\nYou can link files relative to the minecraft directory using \"local://<your file path>\".\n\nPowered by <a href=\"https://github.com/caprica/vlcj\">VLCJ</a>\nVLC 3 is required to play videos (<a href=\"https://videolan.org/\">Download</a>).\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z4CwOWa.png\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/AhcHO9jGwu7QY/giphy.gif\">\n\nLooking for a server to play with your friends.

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n##\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n<br>\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n##\n\n### Placeholders\n<br>\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n##\n\n### Config\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n\n```toml\n# Lets you enable /

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

Simply rightclick the top side of a right side up slab or stair block with an empty hand to sit on it. To exit, press the key you use to exit a minecart (by default SHIFT). Half beds (a bed where only one half is present) work as well. Usually, slabs/stairs from other mods are supported, however if any do not work, please contact me.\n\n### Config\nThere's a single configuration option: *block_reach_distance*. It defines how many blocks a player can be away from a slab/stair to still be able to sit on it. This is capped by the player's block reach distance.\n\nYou are allowed to use this mod in any modpack.","published":"2022-11-20T22:08:54.031136Z","updated":"2023-12-10T13:28:27.530029Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":111486,"followers":243,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["ZGamMOvX","yINjQ1lB","LXRyDeg0","EzTj5ssf","Brq3aRUX","750n2ER4","ShRYww3i","mLqbWtrs","H7GjGSiV","XBTgJEYl","TIZ1pXGN","vPtybpyi","qv4N0o7x","kfUyR9c4","pRcd7ST4","chIzzjRQ","T1eFly6W","3DULg3qo","2qCUCDrD","5VaPxryH","2gEpTXyB","gfyCf0JH","NYlMtDNk","gBDMhF2c","J1KOCf5Q","xcUEOgSz","zwvpqRag","rA1fS1z3","dDkA7QhU","s1n7PxKZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VKXzIykF/f03ccffaebbfc0faa496a34e674090f3a11a99db.png"},"version":{"id":"s1n7PxKZ","project_id":"VKXzIykF","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":true,"name":"1.20.1-v1.3.4","version_number":"v1.3.4","changelog":"- Fix not being able to sit on Snow!

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2611405,"followers":4544,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":160976,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba","sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\aether-1.20.1-1.2.0-neoforge.jar":{"sha512":"c815457cf8dd58b882e3299b92ef45a2e6e5f65819952dedd5d5f516e447e98607821b75647e6aea0000bc92523f9ae5c861ab385e0c558f18f3e0fb93b9a03d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YhmgMVyu","slug":"aether","project_type":"mod","team":"1BnJbCNZ","title":"The Aether","description":"The Aether Team presents the original Aether mod!

alt=\"wiki.gg\"></a>\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ About the Aether ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether Team presents the original Aether mod! Maintained and kept up to date for modern versions of Minecraft and fully compatible with multiplayer!\n\nThe Aether centers around a dimension high in the sky, filled with **vast skylands** of clouds and **floating islands**. This dimension features its own new survival adventure, based around a basic vanilla-esque **survival progression** that features **new ores**, **mythical mobs**, and **three perilous dungeons** each with their own **powerful loot items**.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image0.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ What's in the Mod ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether consists of many new accessible features, most of which are explained in the original forum post for the [Aether Collaboration Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275355-1-7-3-aether-collaboration-mod-v1-02-new-mobs). A brief overview of this content includes:\n* A Hostile Paradise in the sky: the Aether dimension! Just make sure not to fall off of it, or you’ll end up back in the Overworld.\n* A range of new blocks and items accessible from the dimension itself.\n* 3 utility blocks: The Altar, Freezer, and Incubator.\n* 4 material tiers: Skyroot, Holystone, Zanite, and Gravitite, each with their own tools and weapons with unique abilities.\n* The Book of Lore, complete with an entry for every block and item in the mod.\n* An accessory system that lets you utilize the loot you discover.\n* Mobs both reminiscent of the Overworld and unique to the Aether.\n* Moas: a flying mob mount with different tiers of differing jump counts.\n* 3 new structures to conquer: the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Dungeons, each with their own equipment to loot and bosses to defeat.\n* Eternal Day, only able to be ended once the final dungeon is conquered, then the day cycle can be controlled with a unique utility block: the Sun Altar.\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Getting Started ☁️</center></h2>\n\nTo get started with the Aether, you must construct a portal with a **Glowstone frame** and light it with a **water bucket** in the middle, this will activate the portal and allow you to step through and enter the dimension. From here you can begin your survival in the Aether’s hostile paradise!\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image1.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Conquering Dungeons ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether's world contains three new mysterious dungeons, each with a fearsome boss to defeat...\n\nThe **Bronze Dungeon** is the home of the Sentries and guarded by the ominous **Slider**, a creature born of pure stone. Look out for hidden tunnels through islands and prepare yourself with the best gear you can craft!\n\nThe **Silver Dungeon** is the beautiful Valkyrie Temple. Challenge the knights of the Valkyrie Order and, if you prove worthy, fight the **Valkyrie Queen** herself. Utilize every tool and trick you can to best this ancient warrior. \n\nWithin the rare **Gold Dungeon** lies the **Sun Spirit**, an eternal being of pure fire and energy. He is the God that rules the very Sun itself and will take some convincing to even pay attention to a being such as yourself. But it is rumored he guards some of the best treasure that exists in the Aether.  \n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image2.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Join the Conversation ☁️</center></h2>\n\nCome join our Discord server to chat with a growing community of over 10,000 members!\n\nHave a question for the developers?

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

or might be broken completely.  \nPlease refer to our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/12) and\n[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) for ongoing compatibility issues.  \nWhen reporting bugs, please make sure you are using the latest release of Connector and Forgified Fabric API,\nas well as **Forge 47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1\n\n### For improved compatibility with third-party APIs and libraries (REI,EMI,TR Energy), check out [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras).\n\n## 📖 About\n\nSinytra Connector is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to MinecraftForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## 📋 Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install MinecraftForge. We recommend using version **47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.\n3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.\n\nPlease note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while also getting you a fixed version ASAP.\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nSinytra Connector is, and will always remain, licensed under the MIT license.

Unlike most normal biomes, these cave biomes are exceedingly rare - yet they all contain a variety of unique blocks, items, mobs and mechanics that makes them considerable subterranean destinations. These five biomes are the Magnetic Caves, the Primordial Caves, the Toxic Caves, the Abyssal Chasm and the Forlorn Hollows. \n\n \n\nTo find any of these cave biomes, you’ll need to discover an Underground Cabin anywhere in the overworld. From there, you will find loot barrels with cave tablets and a Cave Compendium - a guide book for Alex’s Caves that should provide you with all the knowledge needed to find and explore any biome added by the mod. For more information on getting started, see the ‘[Getting Started](https://alexscaves.wiki.gg/wiki/Guides/Getting_Started)’ section on the mod’s wiki.\n\n \n\nAlex’s Caves is a very large mod with a great deal of effort put into the look and feel of each new biome. Each biome added may have its own ambient particles, fog, brightness, light color and more. Because of this, it is recommended to experience this mod without shaders, since many shaders can alter or worsen the unique appearance of several of the biomes. The mod also has built-in compatibility with Just Enough Items and Alex’s Mobs.\n\n \n\nAny additional questions can be answered on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/alexsmods), and bugs can be reported on [Github](https://github.com/AlexModGuy/AlexsCaves).\n\n \n\n### Credits:\n\n#### Creators:\n- Alexthe668: programmer and co-creator\n- Noonyeyz: artist and co-creator\n\n#### Sound
